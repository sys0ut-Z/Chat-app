1. it would not accept payload more than 100kb, so below is the solution to this problem
-> the image upload works most likely because the file size is under 100KB. By default, Express limits incoming JSON and URL-encoded payloads to 100KB. If your image exceeds this size limit, as it did in my case, the server throws a 413 Payload Too Large error. To resolve this, you need to increase the payload limit in your server configuration. Simply update your index.js file and replace app.use(express.json()); with app.use(express.json({ limit: '10mb' }));, and also include app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true, limit: '10mb' }));. This change will allow your server to handle larger image uploads without throwing the error.

2. '--prefix' flag
  "npm install --prefix frontend"
-> : Install the package(s) in the frontend folder, instead of the current directory.
